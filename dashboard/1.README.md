# Hospital Efficiency Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

### 🏥 Business Problem
Healthcare administrators' need insights into hospital operational efficiency across multiple regions to identify cost-saving opportunities and improve patient care quality.

### 💡 Solution & Insight
Developed a multi-page Power BI dashboard analyzing hospital performance metrics with advanced DAX calculations to reveal efficiency patterns, cost drivers, and regional variations in healthcare delivery.

**Example insights:**
1. Patients discharged to skilled nursing homes had a higher average LOS than the overall state average.
2. Patient illness severity is a key factor for the increase in ALOS and ACPD.

## 🎯 Key Metrics & Analysis

- **ALOS:** Average Length of Stay
- **ACPD:** Average Cost Per Discharge. Serves as a key indicator of hospital cost efficiency   
- **Var_LOS & Var_CPD:** Variability on length of stay/cost per discharge between healthcare area and the state/nation. Serves as a key indicator of regional differences.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Data Modeling:** designed relationship disgram among different tables
- **DAX Calculations:** Created measures and calculated tables
- **Key Influencer Analysis:** Identified primary factors affecting ALOS and ACPD
- **Visualizations:** Built focused and user-friendly dashboards for stakeholder decision-making

## 📈 Business Impact

- ✅ Enabled data-driven decisions for hospital administration
- ✅ Identified cost reduction opportunities through cost analysis
- ✅ Provided regional benchmarking for performance improvement
- ✅ Identified key driver for increasing hospital operation efficiency
