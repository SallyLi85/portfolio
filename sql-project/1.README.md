# Project overview
This is a course project based on open-source data. The main object of this project is to use SQL to prepare the data for further statistical analysis, and perform descriptive analysis with SQL to uncover data patterns. 

# Data Models (RDB) creation
Relevant data entities are being created from the dataset based on the research questions of the project. The relationship among these views is presented with ERD as below.

# Data preparation/processing
The data quality is checked based on *CESSDA data quality dimension framework*, where the data quality is examined in the aspect of following:
* Accuracy
* Completeness
* Consistency
* Timeliness
* Validity
* Uniqueness
  

# ERD creation and implementation
The tables mentioned in the ERD above are being created in this step, with an assigned primary key and foreign keys.
## Data security
2 **SQL triggers** are created for better data traceability. One trigger tracks when there is a new data entry. And the other trigger tracks when there is a data deletion.

# Data Analysis
## Arrest rate analysis
By joining different tables, and counting the number of records after applying various filters. A frequency chart is created to inform the police about high-crime rate districts. This result will help them distribute police power in a more efficient way.

## Time-series analysis
A time series is created to inform the relevant stakeholders about the crime trend over the past ten years. It helps the relevant department to observe the trend (e.g Seasonality), and potentially make a forecast into the future.
